# ðŸš€ Spaceship Titanic

This project is based on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), where the goal is to **predict** which passengers were transported to another dimension.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The objective of the project is to practice and apply what I've been learning in **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing this time on **Neural Networks** and **deployment fundamentals**. This is my **last step** in **traditional supervised machine learning** tasks, from here my learning path will **move on** to **deep learning**, exploring fields like computer vision and natural language processing.

"This is my last step in supervised machine learning for classical regression and classification tasks.
