# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic

This project is based on a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic), where the goal is to **predict** which passengers were transported to another dimension.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of the project is to practice and apply what I've been learning in **Artificial Intelligence**, focusing this time on **Neural Networks** and **deployment fundamentals**. This is my **last step** on **traditional supervised learning** tasks such as regression and classification, from here my learning path will **move on** to **deep learning**, exploring fields like computer vision and natural language processing.
